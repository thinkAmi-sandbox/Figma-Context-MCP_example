# Current Work Focus

We have successfully implemented a React application based on a Figma design. The application includes:

1. A login screen with a "Hello World!" text and a login button
2. An AppBar component with a menu icon, title, and action icon
3. A main screen with the AppBar and placeholder content

## Recent Changes

- Retrieved Figma data using the MCP server
- Downloaded SVG icons from the Figma file
- Created component structure:
  - Basic components: Button, IconButton
  - Composite components: AppBar
  - Screen components: LoginScreen, MainScreen
- Extracted and applied styles from the Figma design:
  - Colors
  - Typography
  - Layout
  - Effects (shadows)
- Updated the App component to display the screens with navigation between them
- Successfully tested the application with Vite development server

## Next Steps

1. Enhance the main screen with more content based on Figma designs
2. Add more functionality to the application
3. Implement proper routing if needed
4. Add form validation for the login screen

## Active Decisions

- Used inline styles instead of CSS Modules for simplicity
- Used Flexbox for layout based on Figma's layout properties
- Created a theme file to centralize style information from Figma
- Implemented a simple state-based navigation between screens
